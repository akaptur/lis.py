lis.py
======

A first attempt at a Lisp/Scheme interpreter written in Python.
I'm trying to use the knowledge I gained from the Coursera Programming
Languages course.

The tests use py.test. If you have already installed PIP you can use
`pip install pytest` to install it. I have only tested lis.py on Python 2.7
on Mac OSX.
